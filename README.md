# Kanban Todo Board

This simple web application provides a three-column Kanban-style board for managing tasks.
It runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Drag tasks between columns to move them
from **Todo** to **In Progress** and finally **Done**.

An example task is provided to get started. You can edit the HTML to add more tasks
or extend the functionality with additional JavaScript if desired.
