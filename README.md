# Kanban Todo Board

This simple web application provides a three-column Kanban-style board for managing tasks.
It runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Drag tasks between columns to move them
from **Todo** to **In Progress** and finally **Done**.

Use the form at the top of the page to create new tasks. Each task requires a
title, description, the creator's name, a date and a priority color. Drag and
drop tasks between columns to update their status. An example task is included
to get started.
